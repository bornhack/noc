# Notes about the network at BornHack 2017


Major Problems:
DHCP floods
ARP floods
Caused by AP Problems
Affect: general badness

Power outage during thunderstorm, everything

Fiber converter - dead, affected south3 link

Didnt make the 802.1x wifi :-(((

Minor Problems
Unifi Controller did Wireless uplink by default
- very hard to find devices which are wireless uplinked :-D

Re-learning Brocade skills

Rogue DHCPD
Time to find better switches, does Brocade have this in our firmwares?
- maybe


Stats

About 250 MACs seen - and not analyzed further than vendor



Ideas

Make NAT network for wired too?
Would you like that for your village, still shared with everyone in camp

Split wifi and wired - in subnets
Requires:
Make pegs in different colors, for PEG DHCP

Make pegs for the badge? or pegs to give out

Public display of graphs ... will be done someday
Printer with 10 pages of paper, and public IP :-D
Chromecast with name "play something fun, obey CoC"
